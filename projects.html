            No-signup, No-AI, and No-Bullshit, Web multitool that can be a photo editor, quick audio editor, code editor, video editor, and more (in the future it only works with audio editing right now). It's open source, and I have a lot of plans for it, but it's already pretty useful as is. Its just an overall swiss army knife for quick edits and things.

            Not my code, but fun to upload the source and help get this spyware out of schools. All the code is ripped and extracted from the crx I downloaded directly through the extension update manifest. Also very interesting what domains they block which you can look at on urls in the <a href="https://github.com/freezeoncrack/securly-source-code/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a>
