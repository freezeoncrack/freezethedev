<body>
  <p>AI was used only to help speed up the making of this project. Its role was limited to fixing bugs, providing inline suggestions via GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, and speeding up parts of the development process.  Any code made by AI was double-checked by a human before being used. AI was not used to generate the project itself, only as a tool to improve efficiency while coding.</p>
